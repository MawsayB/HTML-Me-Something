        <p>There are many places, common and rare, that we might think we want to visit.  While hotels are easy to book, there are many other
            destinations where I have laid my head or I have played.  These places have been such a treasure to explore that I want to make 
            sure that others are aware of some worthwhile experiences to have during your lifetime.  </p>

        <p>"If you foolishly ignore beauty, you will soon find yourself without it. 
            Your life will be impoverished. But if you invest in beauty,
            it will remain with you all the days of your life."</p>
        <p>-Frank Lloyd Wright</p>
